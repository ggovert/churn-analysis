# Churn Prediction

In this project, I will apply the knowledge gained to perform customer churn prediction using Telco data. I will utilize several classification models, including logistic regression, SVM, RandomForest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost. I will thoroughly document the details of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process and modeling in the notebook. Following that, I will utilize Flask API for the deployment process.
